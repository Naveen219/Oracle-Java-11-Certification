#Oracle Java 11 Certification Guide

Hey there! 👋 Thanks for stopping by.

I created this repository while preparing for my Oracle Java 11 Certification exam, and I've made it public to help others who are on the same journey. If you're looking for resources to prepare for the certification or need a quick guide to refer to, you're in the right place! 🎯

What's inside:
A curated set of resources designed to guide you through Java 11 concepts.
Concurrency Visualization Tool: I’ve also included the concurrency jar I obtained from the official Oracle Java documentation. If concurrency concepts seem confusing (like they did for me when I first encountered them!), this tool will help you visualize and better understand how concurrency works in Java. 🚀
Feel free to explore, and I hope this helps with your exam prep! Good luck! 🍀
